# Tetris Game Project

## Introduction
This Tetris game project is being developed as part of the DEV4 course by Umut and Rayan from the D112 group. The project aims to implement a classic Tetris game using C++ and the Qt framework (for the GUI).

## Developers
- **Rayan** (Matricule: 58923)
-  **Umut** (Matricule: 58620)

## Description
Tetris is a classic puzzle game where the player arranges falling tetrominoes (shapes made up of four square blocks) to form complete rows. When a row is complete, it is cleared from the board, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing area.

## Development Status
This project is currently in the modeling phase. Development will start soon.

## Planned features
- Basic Tetris gameplay mechanics
- Customizable board size and level
- Support for different tetromino shapes
- Score tracking and level progression
- Simple console-based user interface (GUI coming later)

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the falling tetrominoes.
5. Press the down arrow key to drop the tetromino faster.
6. Try to complete as many rows as possible to score points and advance to higher levels.

## Development Environment
- Language: C++
- IDE: QtCreator and CLion
- Compiler: GCC 13.2
