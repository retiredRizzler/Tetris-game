# Tetris Game Project

## Introduction
This Tetris game project is being developed as part of the DEV4 course by Umut and Rayan from the D112 group. The project aims to implement a classic Tetris game using C++ and the Qt framework (for the GUI).

## Developers
- **Rayan** (matricule: **58923**)
-  **Umut** (matricule: **58620**)

## Description
Tetris is a classic puzzle game where the player arranges falling tetrominoes (shapes made up of four square blocks) to form complete rows. When a row is complete, it is cleared from the board, and the player earns points. The game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing area.

## Development Status
This project is currently in the modeling phase. Development will start soon.

## Planned features
- Basic Tetris gameplay mechanics
- Customizable board size and level
- Support for different tetromino shapes
- Score tracking and level progression
- Simple console-based user interface (GUI coming later)

## How to Play
Coming soon...

## Development Environment
- Language: C++
- IDE: QtCreator
- Compiler: GCC 13.2
